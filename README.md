Feed Forward networks are great for learning the mapping between numerical input and output data.

Through this code I have tried to implement and understand a simple feed forward network. All thanks to Siraj Raval's Build Neural Network in 4 minutes tutorial on youtube.

The python code builds a simple three layer neural network. The layers are input layer, hidden layer, and output layer.
The input layer contains 3 nodes.
The hidden layer has 4 nodes.
The output layer has only one node.

-----------------------------------------
             Input	           |  Output
-----------------------------------------
0            0             1   |    0
0            1             1   |    1
1            0             1   |    1
1            1             1   |    0

The models gradually learns to produce an output which is very close to the actual output. # simple_neural_net
